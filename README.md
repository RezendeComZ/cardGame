# TODOs (?)

- Fix final card animation
- Allow settings on file (e.g: SETTINGS: ordered cardColor(150, 150, 150), borderColor(white) bgColor(150, 150, 100), textColor(200, 200, 200) ORIGINALCASE LOOP NOGROUPNAME)
- Do not display group name when using NOGROUPNAME setting
- Card opacity animation at start
- Better CSS for desktop and mobile
- Upload custom file with questions
- Question file generator (other project?)
- Catch errors, throw on screen (e.g: "file not found, format not supported)
